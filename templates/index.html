        <p>Idea AId is a webapp that aims to help people come up with ideas for
            anything. Through the use of OpenAI's API, the app communicates with
            the GPT-4 Turbo chat bot in order to get data to make questions and then
            generate ideas from those questions.
            <br>
            The website was created by First Last, First Last and First Last in december
            of 2023 for the harvard CS50 course final project.
