#### Description:

Idea-AId is a project in the form of a webapp desgned to give inspiration and ideas to people to allow them to test, develop or expand their skills in any genre, field or area. By answering questions through both pre-set and custom responses, users can expand their creativity, learn and find problems to solve. Through the use of openAI's chatGPT-4 API, questions are generated off of previous responses and the five total questions will provide input to GPT-4, which will generate multiple ideas to be used by the user. Each idea can then be expanded upon, again through the help of GPT-4, or saved. 

The users' ID is stored through sessions.
